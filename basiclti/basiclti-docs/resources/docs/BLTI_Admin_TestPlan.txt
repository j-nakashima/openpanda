This is to test the adinistration tool "basiclti-tool"

1.0 Admin Functionality

1.1 Log in as admin, go into "Administrator Workspace" (!admin), and use "Sites" tool to add an new page "External Tools" and add the tool "sakai.basiclti.admin" to the page.  When done, you should see a new External Tools link in the Administration Workspace with a cool little icon.

1.2 Go into the tool and press "Add New" - this will add a new tool give it a title, set the following fields
URL: http://www.imsglobal.org/developers/BLTI/tool.php
Key: 12345
Secret: secret
Leave all of the rest of the values default and create the tool

1.3 Go into "Content Items" and press "Add New" - pick the tool you just created from the drop down, give it a title - leave the site id blank and press Save.

1.4 Back at the content item list you should *not* see a "Test" link because it is not properly configured.  Press Edit and add the site id as "!admin" and press Save.  Now you should see a "Test" button.

1.5 Press the Test button - it should launch the IMS text tool in a new window.

1.6 Press the Edit button, change the title, press "Cancel" and verify that the title did not change.

1.7 Press the Delete button and then press Cancel and verify that nothing was deleted.

1.8 Press the "Delete" butting in the content item list and press "Delete" in the confirmation screen and verify that is is indeed gone.

1.9 Re-create the item using "Add New"

1.10 Press "Done" to go back to the Tool List.  Edit the tool and change all the radio buttons with an "Allow" option to be Allow and press "Save"

1.11 Go into Content items and edit the item.  You should see all the fields you just enabled.  Set "Launch in debug mode" and press "Save".

1.12 Back in the Content Item list, press "Test" - it should launch in debug mode.  Copy this URL into a file somewhere then press "Continue" and you should proceed to the IMS test tool.  My URL was http://localhost:8080/access/basiclti/site/!admin/content:8 - yours will have a different number likely.  Save the URL for a later step.

1.13 Go back to the list of tools and press "Add New".  Test data validation either one at a time or all at the same time.  (1) leave a required field blank, (2) put a non-number in a numeric field, (3) put a non-url in a URL field.  When you press "Save" you should see an error list showing all the things wrong with the insert and the previous data should be there.  Press "Cancel" when done.

1.14 Go back to the list of tools and edit the existing tool.  Make bad data entries.  If you put in bad or missing data, you should see an error message for each of the errors, the data should not be updated and the edit screen will reappear with the old data from the database (i.e. the POST data is lost).

1.15 You can test the mapping ability to add/edit/delete mappings.   Enter bad data (it demands URLs).  These are not implemented yet but their data can be stored and retrieved.

1.14 If you see a button at the top of the tool called "Test" - press it.   You should see a bunch of pre-formatted output.  Watch the log when you do this - there should be no log errors.   The final line of the output should be "Return value from delete=true" if it was successful.   It is a bug if you see a traceback or the test completes before it omelets the delete.  You can run the Test multiple times - if it works, it cleans up after itself.  You should verify in the list of tools and the list of content items that the Test does not create either a new tool nor a new content item.

2.0 Instructor Use Cases

2.1 Create a new account.  Make sure to give it a name and e-mail address.

2.2 Open a new tab and paste the URL you saved earlier like http://localhost:8080/access/basiclti/site/!admin/content:8 into the address bar.  You should get an error "Access to the specified resource () has been forbidden."

2.3 Create a new site and go into Site Info - you should see a new option labeled "External Tools".  Press it.

2.4 You should see the global tools created by the administrator.  You should *not* see a Mapping nor Test menu option.  Press "Done" to verify you go back to the Main Site Info page.

2.5 Go back into "External tools" and go into "Content Items" - there should be no content items.  Press "Add New" to add a new content item.  The drop-down should show the global tool created by the administrator.  Pick it.  You should see all the options that the tool has "allowed" us to set in a content item.  Give the new content item a title, turn on debug mode, and press Save.

2.6 Back in the content items, press Delete then Cancel, edit then cancel, then edit, change the title and press save verifying that all work as expected.

2.7 Back in Content Items - press "Test"  It should launch in a new window and you should see debug output - press to continue and see that it works.

2.8 Go back to tools and create a new external tool for this site.  Give it a title, fill in the required fields (see above) and leave everything else default and press "Save".  The tool should appear in the list of tools.

2.9 (As Admin in Different Browser) look at the list of external tools in the !admin site - the new tool should show up and it should have a non-blank SITE_ID - global tools have a blank (NULL in the DB) SITE_ID;

2.10 (As instructor again) Go into Content Items and press "Add New".  Note that both the local and global tools are available here.  Pick the newly created local tool.  You should not see a site_id field on the Add New Content screen when you are instructor. Give the item a title and press "Save".  It should now be present in the list of content items.

2.11 Exercise the Edit/Cancel, Edit/Save, and Delete/Cancel paths and verify proper operation. 

2.12 Click on Test.  It should open without debug mode and go directly to the IMS test tool.

2.13 (As admin) Go into Content Items.  You should see both the global and local content items.  Test should work for all the content items including the local items in the site.

2.14 (As instructor) - Edit the local tool, and set debug to "On" (i.e. not allow) and save the tool.

2.15 Go into content items and press Edit on the content item associated with the local tool and verify that the debug option does *not* show up.  Press Cancel in the Edit screen.

2.16 Launch the content item using Test - it should launch in Debug mode.

3.0 Tool Options

In this series of tests, you will really need two browsers with one as the admin and one as the instructor.  You will be editing the global tool and repeatedly launching the tool from the course / Site Info / External Tools / Content Items.

3.1 (Admin) Edit the global tool, change the secret to "zzz" and press Save.

3.2 (Instructor) Launch the associated content item and process past the debug screen.   It should fail with "Could not establish context: Invalid signature"

3.3 (Admin) Edit the global tool set the secret back to "secret" and press Save.

3.4 (Instructor) Launch the associated content item examine the debug screen to make sure *none* of these fields are present:
lis_person_contact_email_primary=csev@umich.edu
lis_person_name_family=Severance
lis_person_name_full=Charles Severance
lis_person_name_given=Charles
=
3.5 (Admin) Edit the global tool always send of names and email addresses and press Save.

3.6 (Instructor) Launch the associated content item examine the debug screen to make sure that these fields are present:
lis_person_contact_email_primary=csev@umich.edu
lis_person_name_family=Severance
lis_person_name_full=Charles Severance
lis_person_name_given=Charles

3.7 (Admin) Edit the global tool change "Enabled" to "Disabled" and press Save.

3.8 (Instructor) Launch the associated content item and it should fail saying, "Tool is currently disabled"

3.9 (Admin) Edit the global tool change "Disabled" to "Enabled", enable additional custom parameters, enter x=1 and y=2 on two separate lines in the custom screen and press Save.

3.10 (Instructor) Launch the associated content item and verify that these parameters are present:
custom_x=1
custom_y=2

3.11 (Instructor) Edit the content item and notice that there is now a custom parameters field. Enter y=9 and z=10 on two separate lines in the custom screen and press Save.

3.12 (Instructor) Launch the associated content item and verify that these parameters are present:
custom_x=1
custom_y=2
custom_z=10
In particular, the custom_y value comes from the *tool* - not the content item.  When there is a match, the tool overrides the content item.

4.0 Student Use Cases

You will likely need a third window for the student.  Since there is no integration into Lesson Builder yet, we will have to test the launch URLs manually.

4.1 Create another account and enroll the account in the site as a Learner or access.

4.2 When you go into the site / Site Info you should not see any tools in the top menu much less the External Tools option.

4.3 (Instructor) Go into the content items list, and copy the link under "Test" for both items (local tool and global tool) and manually enter them into another tab in the Student browser.  The should both function properly.  The urls look like this:
http://localhost:8080/access/basiclti/site/8beed728-57f1-4630-9278-d1c6beb672d9/content:11

4.4 (Admin) Go into the content items list and find the one item belonging to "!admin" and copy its "Test" link into the student browser - it should fail with "Access to the specified resource () has been forbidden.". The url should look like this with the !admin in the URL.
http://localhost:8080/access/basiclti/site/!admin/content:8

4.5 Manually change the sited in the URL to be the site the student is a member of but keep the content id for the !admin content.  It should also fail but with a message of "Content item is missing or improperly configured.".  The URL should look like:
http://localhost:8080/access/basiclti/site/8beed728-57f1-4630-9278-d1c6beb672d9/content:8

4.6 (Instructor) Manually copy various "Edit" and "Delete" urls from both the content and tool screens and manually paste them into the student location.  In each case it should fail with a message like "Alert: Must be site maintainer to edit".

4.7 (Admin) Manually copy various "Edit" and "Delete" urls from the content, tool, and mapping screens and manually paste them into the student location.  In each case these should fail with "The requested resource (//localhost:8080/portal/tool/a691bb6b-a7f1-44b4-b053-13cb2a3d4790) is not available." since the student is not even n the !admin site.

4.8 Note that the "Test" Urls form either the Instructor or Admin screens for content items all should work as long as they are for the site the student is a member of.
